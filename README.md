An AI agent to help you file tax returns easily. 

Why another tax-filing app? From tech POV, every tax law change requires TurboxTax to reprogram their backend. This costs them and eventually costs end users. 

**SOLUTION:** 
The law change could be easily reflected by updates in JSON files that are consumed by AI. A normal person without coding knowledge can easily update JSON files and eventually reduces cost on end users.
